Basic For Loops: begins with the for keyword, followed by parentheses, then open and closed braces. Within the parentheses are three things. First, we must declare a variable. This is what the loop loops over. Then, we will set a conditional expression. The loop will contnue happening until this statement is false. Third, we will increment our variable. All three of these statements are separated by a semicolon.

The ++ Operator: Javascript shorthand for 'Set the value of the variable to its current value plus one'.

Infinite Loops: Never set within the parentheses the following infinite loop: for(let i=0;i>=0;i++) as this condition will always be true i will never be les than zero, it causes the loop to run indefinitely, until the program breaks, or the computer/browser crashes.
